## Replit Agent Prompt

Create a **TrackMyTamiya** - application for tracking and managing Tamiya RC car models with photos, build logs, and hop-up parts tracking, and a Foto frame functionality. Imagine to use the phone for documenting builds and taking or uploading photos. A tablet will be used for the photoframe and a desktop Pc as a third use case for model management.
The app matches Tamiya’s branding and color scheme (red, white, and blue, clean and mechanical styling). The app should help users manage and document their personal collection of Tamiya RC cars. Platform & UI Primary use case is mobile (Android/iOS), but the app must also function smoothly on desktop browsers. UI should follow responsive design principles with mobile-first layouts. The visual design must match Tamiya’s style — crisp edges, white backgrounds, technical font choices, and a red/blue palette.
